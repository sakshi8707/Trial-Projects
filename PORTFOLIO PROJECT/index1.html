              Well, if it's not obvious by now from the site design philosophy, I am a programmer. Or atleast I choose to call myself one üòÅ
              </p>
              <p class="theme-light">
              At the time of writing, I am in the final year of my 4 year undergraduate degree course in IT engineering. Other than that, I am interning at Juspay as an SDE.
            </p>
            <p class="theme-light">
              My life is pretty much engulfed by coding now. Basically, I am married to my laptop. If I'm not working on my laptop, I'm probably playing on it. I'm very into Valorant at the moment [// Riot is one hell of a studio]. If we share a common interest, ping me @djroxx2000 #DJRX
            </p>
            <p class="theme-light">
              I am also a huge music guy! If I'm married to my laptop then my headphone is my child [// This metaphor has been stretched as far as possible]. I have a huge playlist [// It's about 61h at the moment], which is mostly just Dance Pop on spotify which you can find at the very end of this website. Sorting it in chronological order will show you as well as anyone can, the phases I've been through in life, lol.

              Surely, just like the rest, I also indulge in binge watching streaks. Netflix is a thing of beauty both from a technological and a content-based perspective. I find myself repeating my comfort shows and movies more than I turn to newer content but I do crack under peer pressure and find myself requiring to stay up to date on the latest exploits of the Starks and the Professor and other "Stranger Things".
